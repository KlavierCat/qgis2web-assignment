          This interactive map presents a streamlined version of two QGIS maps
          originally created to showcase Apollo landing sites on the Moon. Due
          to QGIS2Web plugin limitations, which prevent integration of lunar
          base maps via the required WMS server, the base maps are not included
          in this adaptation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The map features two key layers: one illustrating the major lunar
          maria (vast, dark plains on the Moonâ€™s surface) and another
          pinpointing the Apollo mission landing sites. Hover over a landing
          site to view pop-up details, including crew information and mission
          dates. A search feature allows you to locate sites by mission name.
          Zooming in or out may reveal additional names of notable lunar maria.
