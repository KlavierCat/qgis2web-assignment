          The map, <strong>GPs in Ireland</strong>, visualizes the distribution
          of General Practitioners (GPs) across Ireland by county. It includes
          three distinct data layers, each representing a different aspect of GP
          distribution, which you can toggle on and off using the layer control
          in the interactive map. The three layers are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>GPs per 100,000 residents by county</li>
          <li>GPs per 100 square kilometers by county</li>
          <li>Total number of GPs by county</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The data was aggregated and processed using Node.js.</p>

        <p>
          For comparison, the map <strong>GPs in the EU</strong> provides an
          overview of GP distribution across Europe, showing the number of GPs
          per 100,000 residents by country.

          This page is responsive: on larger screens, the two maps are displayed
          side by side; on smaller screens, they stack vertically for easier
          viewing.
