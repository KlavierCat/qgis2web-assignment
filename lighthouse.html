          The Irish Isles are home to a remarkable collection of lighthouses,
          each with its own unique history and charm. This map presents the
          lighthouses of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,
          using data from
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank"
            >OpenStreetMap</a
          >. When you hover over an icon on the map, a pop-up will appear,
          displaying details about each lighthouse.
