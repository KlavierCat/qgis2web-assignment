          This map was created as part of a survey of amenities in
          <a href="https://www.deafvillageireland.ie/" target="_blank"
            >Deaf Village Ireland</a
          >. Each type of amenities is organized into its own layer, allowing
          you to toggle individual layers on or off using the interactive map
          controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you hover over an icon, a pop-up appears with information related
          to the amenity. The pop-upâ€™s background color matches the shade of the
          icon for visual consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map is designed to reduce clutter: as you zoom in, additional
          features may appear, revealing more details at closer zoom levels.
